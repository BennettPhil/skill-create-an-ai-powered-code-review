Idea prompt: Create an AI-powered code review system that analyzes pull requests for security vulnerabilities, performance bottlenecks, architectural anti-patterns, test coverage gaps, accessibility issues in frontend code, API versioning compliance, database query optimization opportunities, memory leak detection, thread safety issues, and generates a comprehensive report with auto-fix suggestions for each finding. It should also learn from past reviews and team preferences over time.
